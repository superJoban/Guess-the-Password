# Guess-the-Password

CPSC 329 Final project: (unessay)

This program runs a game where the user is given a profile and they attempt to guess the password of the profile with given information.
After the guessing is done the user is given a score based on how many letters they guessed correct.
Finally the user will be given the opportunity to create a new improved password for each profile and then view the submissions of updated passwords from other users.
